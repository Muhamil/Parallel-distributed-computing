### **IPC.PY**
Demonstrates inter-process communication using Python's `multiprocessing` module with a `Queue`.

- **Producer Process**: Generates integers (0â€“4) and places them into the queue.
- **Consumer Process**: Retrieves integers from the queue and processes them.
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates the producer-consumer pattern with multiprocessing.

### **MPI.PY**
Uses the `mpi4py` library to demonstrate inter-process communication in a distributed environment.

- **Rank 0**: Sends a dictionary to Rank 1.
- **Rank 1**: Receives and prints the dictionary.
- **Other Ranks**: Remain idle.
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates message passing in parallel computing.

### **MULTI_PROCESS.PY**
Compares multiprocessing and multithreading for a random number generation task.

- **Multiprocessing**: Spawns multiple processes for parallel execution.
- **Multithreading**: Uses threads to perform the same task concurrently.
- **Output**: Execution times for both methods.
- **Purpose**: Highlights performance differences between multiprocessing and multithreading.

### **PCNM.PY**
Demonstrates basic multiprocessing by calculating the square and cube of a number concurrently.

- **Process 1**: Computes the square of a number.
- **Process 2**: Computes the cube of a number.
- **Purpose**: Illustrates parallel task execution.

### **PARALLILSM.PY**
Showcases data parallelism using NumPy for vector addition.

- **Key Feature**: Utilizes NumPy's internal parallelism for fast computation on large datasets.
- **Output**: Execution time and first 10 elements of the result.
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates efficient data parallelism with optimized libraries.

### **SHARED_MEM.PY**
Demonstrates thread-safe shared memory access with locks.

- **Deposit Function**: Adds an amount to a shared balance.
- **Withdraw Function**: Subtracts an amount from the shared balance.
- **Purpose**: Highlights safe shared memory access in a multithreading environment.

### **SYNC.PY**
Illustrates thread synchronization using a semaphore.

- **Semaphore**: Limits access to a shared resource to two threads at a time.
- **Threads**: Simulate concurrent access to a resource.
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates controlled access to shared resources using semaphores.

### **TASK_PARALILLSM.PY**
Demonstrates task parallelism using the `ThreadPoolExecutor`.

- **Tasks**: Executes two functions concurrently.
- **Purpose**: Highlights how to manage multiple tasks in parallel with high-level APIs.

### **FIBONACCI.PY**
Calculates the Fibonacci sequence using multithreading.

- **Threads**: Compute Fibonacci numbers concurrently for the same input.
- **Output**: Results and execution time for each thread.
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates parallel computation of a recursive algorithm.

### **PIPE.PY**
Showcases inter-process communication using a `Pipe`.

- **Parent Process**: Sends a message to the child process and receives a processed response.
- **Child Process**: Converts the message to uppercase and sends it back.
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates bidirectional communication between processes using pipes.
