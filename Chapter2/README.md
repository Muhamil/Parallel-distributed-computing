# Threading with Python: Synchronization and Thread Management

This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate various threading concepts and synchronization techniques. Each script showcases different ways of managing thread execution, synchronization, and shared resource access. These techniques are crucial for writing efficient and safe multithreaded applications, where multiple threads interact with each other or with shared resources.

## Files Overview

### **BARRIER.PY**
This script demonstrates the use of the `Barrier` synchronization primitive in Python's `threading` module. A `Barrier` is used when multiple threads need to wait until a certain number of threads have reached a specific point (the barrier) before they can proceed. This is useful when you need to synchronize threads after they have completed their individual tasks but need to wait for each other to start the next phase of execution. 

In this script, several threads are created, and they all wait at the barrier. Once the required number of threads have arrived, they all proceed together.

### **CONDITION.PY**
This script demonstrates the use of a `Condition` object, which is used for synchronizing threads that need to wait for a certain condition before continuing. A `Condition` can be used in producer-consumer scenarios where a producer thread produces an item, and the consumer thread consumes it. The consumer thread waits until the item is produced, and the producer signals the consumer that the item is available using `condition.notify()`.

In this script, a consumer thread waits for the producer to generate an item before it can consume it. The `condition.wait()` and `condition.notify()` methods manage the communication between threads.

### **EVENT.PY**
This script demonstrates the use of an `Event` to coordinate the execution of threads. An `Event` is a simple synchronization primitive that allows one thread to signal other threads. In this script, a producer thread sets the event to signal the consumer that an item has been produced. The consumer thread waits for the event to be set using `event.wait()` before it proceeds to consume the item.

The main use case of `Event` is to signal one or more threads that they can proceed with their task, enabling better control of thread execution.

### **MYTHREADCLASS.PY**
This script demonstrates how to create custom threads by subclassing Python's `Thread` class. It shows how to define the behavior of a thread by overriding the `run()` method. Each thread runs the code defined in `run()` when the `start()` method is called.

In this script, the `run()` method simply prints a message indicating the thread's execution. This is a simple example to show how to create and run threads in Python.

### **MYTHREADCLASS_LOCK.PY**
This script demonstrates the use of a `Lock` to manage access to shared resources among multiple threads. A `Lock` ensures that only one thread can access a critical section of code at a time, preventing race conditions and data corruption. In this script, multiple threads attempt to increment a shared counter, but only one thread can access the counter at a time because the `lock` ensures mutual exclusion.

This example showcases how to use a lock to synchronize thread access to shared data and ensure thread safety.

### **MYTHREADCLASS_LOCK_2.PY**
This script uses a `RLock` (reentrant lock) to demonstrate thread synchronization. A `RLock` allows a thread to acquire the lock multiple times. This is particularly useful when a thread needs to lock a resource multiple times in nested function calls. 

In this script, the thread uses the `RLock` to safely modify a shared resource by locking and unlocking the resource multiple times within the same thread. It highlights the use of `RLock` in more complex, recursive threading scenarios.

### **RLOCK.PY**
This script demonstrates how to use a `RLock` to safely manage access to a shared resource, a `Box` that tracks the total number of items. Multiple threads add and remove items from the box, and the `RLock` ensures that the total count is updated correctly, even if a thread acquires the lock multiple times.

In this example, the threads simulate adding and removing items from the box, and the `RLock` ensures that these operations are thread-safe, preventing race conditions and inconsistent data.

### **SEMAPHORE.PY**
This script demonstrates the use of a `Semaphore`, a synchronization primitive used to control access to a shared resource with a limited capacity. A semaphore maintains an internal counter, and threads can acquire or release the semaphore to control access to the resource. In this script, the producer produces items and signals the consumer using the semaphore.

The `Semaphore` is initialized with 0, meaning the consumer is initially blocked until the producer signals that an item is available. This example simulates a producer-consumer problem using a semaphore to synchronize the two threads.

### **THREAD_DEFINITION.PY**
This script demonstrates the creation and management of multiple threads. It creates 10 threads, each running a simple function that prints a message with the thread number. The script demonstrates how to create threads dynamically in a loop and start them.

Each thread prints the number associated with it, showing how threads are defined and executed in parallel. The script also demonstrates the use of `join()` to ensure that the main program waits for all threads to finish before exiting.

### **THREAD_DETERMINE.PY**
This script demonstrates running multiple threads concurrently, each executing a function (`function_A`, `function_B`, `function_C`) that simulates some work by sleeping for 2 seconds. Each thread prints a message indicating when it starts and finishes, showing how threads can run independently while synchronizing their start and end points.

This example highlights the concurrent execution of threads, where each function runs in its own thread, allowing parallel execution of multiple tasks.

### **THREAD_NAME_AND_PROCESSES.PY**
This script demonstrates how to create custom threads using the `Thread` class and assign them names. It shows how to run threads concurrently and identify them by their names and process IDs. 

Each thread prints its name and the process ID, helping you understand how threads are managed and executed in a multi-threaded environment. This script is a basic introduction to creating and running threads with custom names.

### **THREADING_WITH_QUEUE.PY**
This script simulates a producer-consumer problem using a `Queue`, which is a thread-safe data structure used for communication between threads. The producer generates random items and adds them to the queue, while multiple consumer threads remove and process items from the queue.

The script ensures thread-safe communication using the queue, preventing race conditions between the producer and consumer threads. It demonstrates how a `Queue` can be used to synchronize threads in a multithreading environment, where the producer and consumers work concurrently.
