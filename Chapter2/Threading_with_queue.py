# Explanation:
# This program demonstrates thread synchronization using the Queue module in Python. The Queue provides a thread-safe FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
# structure for sharing data between threads. Here, we have one producer thread and multiple consumer threads.
# 
# - The producer thread generates random numbers and appends them to the queue.
# - The consumer threads pop items from the queue as they become available and process them.
# 
# The queue ensures thread-safe operations between producer and consumer threads. The `put()` and `get()` methods of the queue ensure that 
# data is safely shared and synchronized. The consumer threads will block (wait) until there are items available in the queue to consume.
# 
# - The `task_done()` method is used to signal that a consumer thread has finished processing an item.
# 
# In summary, the program simulates a producer-consumer problem where a producer generates items and multiple consumers process them concurrently.
# The use of thread synchronization via the queue ensures that there is no race condition or data inconsistency between the threads.
