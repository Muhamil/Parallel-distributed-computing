#This program simulates a race between three runners: Huey, Dewey, and Louie.
# Each runner is a separate thread that takes a random amount of time (2-5 seconds) to reach a common finish line.
# A Barrier ensures all runners wait at the finish line until everyone arrives. Once all runners are there, the program prints that the race is over. 
# It shows when each runner reaches the barrier with their name and the time.
# Barrier to synchronize runners, ensuring all runners reach the finish line before proceeding
# Function that simulates a runner's actions during the race.
